# Tideflow Trigger Application

> Mobile application to easily trigger workflows.

In order to help developers to boost their imagination and peace, we have developed this mobile application (using Ionic) that already integrates with Tideflow.

Specificly it integrates with any workflow that is triggered via a endpoint.

Some of its features:

- Integrates with User API Key. One QR is enought to authenticate yourself.
- Send basic JSON objects.
- Scan barcodes and QR codes and trigger your workflows.
- Take photos and trigger your workflows with them.
- Documment scanning (photo tilt correction) to trigger workflows.
